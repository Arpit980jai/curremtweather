# curremtweather

This Flutter project is a mobile application that fetches and displays current weather conditions for a specified location using the Weatherbit Current Weather API. The app allows users to input a city name or use their device's location (via latitude and longitude) to retrieve real-time weather data, including temperature, humidity, wind speed, and weather descriptions. The app features a clean, user-friendly interface and handles API requests efficiently with error handling.
